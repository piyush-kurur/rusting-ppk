# Piyush learns to Rust

This repository contains sample code that I used while learning rust.
Starting from the very first code example to the (hopefully) most
complex code that I write will be here. It is also an experiment to
see

1. How quickly I learn rust?

2. Is rust feasible as a programming language for a first course?
